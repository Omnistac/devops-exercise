# Overview

The technical round will consist of a pair programming session that will include access to a private GitHub repository.

The session will be guided by a series of problems. The problems are designed to be open-ended and the environment is designed to be highly collaborative between you and the interviewer.

Please make sure you have the following ready before the session:

- A working code editor, such as VSCode, Cursor, or WebStorm.
- A GitHub Account, with `git` setup locally to clone repositories.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed

The session will require sharing your screen.
